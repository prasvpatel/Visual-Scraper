# Visual-Scraper
Given a user-inputted keyword, the webapp begins scraping at several image databases, and extends its crawl to as many embedded links as necessary. The result is a list of visual graphics ordered by relevance. Relevance can be influenced by an user-inputted five-star review system. However, Relevance is chiefly determined through the web-crawling algorithm.
